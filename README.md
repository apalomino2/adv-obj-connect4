### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Develop a Connect4 Game application. The Connect	Four	game	is	a	two-player	connection
game	in	which	the	players	take turns	dropping	their	discs	from	the	top	into	a	seven-column,	
six-row	vertically suspended	grid	[Wikipedia].	The	pieces	fall	straight	down,	occupying	the
next available	space	within	the	column.	The	objective	of	the	game	is	to	connect	four	of 
one's	own	discs	next	to	each	other	vertically,	horizontally,	or	diagonally	before	your 
opponent.
